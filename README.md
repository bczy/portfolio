# trambz' playground
## Description
I made this test in order to test react hooks, [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) and [react-three-fiber](react-three-fiber) made by [Paul Henschel](https://github.com/drcmda).

My original idea was to make a portfolio that quickly became a pixel art graphic demo.

React hooks made this adventure really interesting and live up to my expectations.

This project also allowed me If you love animations and 3d stuff and smooth animation go check those librairies!
