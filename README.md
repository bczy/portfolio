# trambz' playground
## Description
I made this test in order to test react hooks flexibility.
My original idea was to make a portfolio that quickly became a pixel art graphic demo.

React hooks made this adventure really interesting and live up to my expectations.

This project also allowed me to try [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) and [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/drcmda/react-three-fiber). If you love animations and 3d stuff those two librairies are worth a try!
